An attempt to help aid the unknown...how to best sequence your pitches. Using Driveline's internal stuff+ model 
this application looks to take the guessing game out of sequencing. Based on stuff+ numbers for YOUR pitches and 
their locations then applying that to a simulated at-bat, you'll be given a roadmap on how to best maneveur around a 
batter. Currently in development phase.
